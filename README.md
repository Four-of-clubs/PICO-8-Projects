# PICO-8-Projects
A small collection of the projects I have made to run in PICO-8 - A lua-based, old-school-styled game engine!


As of August 2023, I am putting together this GitHub page to backup and showoff some of the work I've done in PICO-8 over the past ~2 years. 
These were all personal projects made simply for the joy of it.

I'm putting together a webpage to better show off my love projects before 2024 - Check it out at the link here:
